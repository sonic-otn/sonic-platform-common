# Design of y-cable driver implemented multiple vendor API for mux simulator

The mux simulator exposes a set of APIs for the client. To access the APIs, the client needs to know some key information:
1. The mux simulator server IP and port
2. The vm_set information
3. The port index

Port index is know to the y-cable driver. So, we need to pass items #1-#3 to the y-cable driver. We can update the existing [test_inject_y_cable_simulator_client](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/tests/test_pretest.py#L182) test case to pass server IP/port and vm_set information to the DUT during pretest.

Simply create a json file to `/etc/sonic/mux_simulator.json` with content like
```
{
    "server_ip": "192.168.0.10",
    "server_port": "8000",
    "vm_set": "vms17-7",
    "side": "upper_tor"
}
```
